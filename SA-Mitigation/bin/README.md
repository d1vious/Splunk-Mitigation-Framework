Attack Mitigation Scripts
=========================

### mitigator\_endpoint.py
* Requires: Authentication for remote Splunk Agents instances under credential manager of ES under Realm `LWF`.

This script makes a custom rest call to populate the `process_queue.csv` lookup in the remote splunk instances telling it what to block.

### mitigator\_network.py
* Requires: Authentication for the remote Palo Alto firewalls under credential manager in ES with Realm `PAN`.

This script is a modification of the pan block which uses credential manager, adds IPs to a designated group in a Palo Alto.
